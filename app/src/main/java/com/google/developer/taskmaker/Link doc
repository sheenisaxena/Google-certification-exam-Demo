1. New version of android studio.
2. Once you sign up and pay the certification fee($99), you’ll have 48 hours to submit the exam.

	How does the process work?

    The Associate Android Developer Certification process works like this:

	Complete the registration process and pay for, download, and complete your exam.
	After you complete the exam, you will submit it for grading. You will need to include a PDF copy of a verifiable government-issued ID (passport, driver license, etc.) with your exam submission, so have that ready before you begin.
	Your submitted exam will be reviewed by a combination of machine and human grading, and you’ll be notified of your exam results. Based on the results of your exam, you will find out if you passed and will move on to the exit interview, or if you will need to attempt the exam again.
	If you passed the exam, you will be able to set up your exit interview. This will be a chance for you to explain your work, and you’ll once again provide proof of your identity.
	Upon successfully passing the exit interview, you will be awarded your Associate Android Developer Certification.

	Note: Exams will be graded in the order that they are submitted. Due to the in-person nature of the exit interview portion, the awarding of certifications will depend on when you are able to complete your interview. It is our intention to review completed exam submissions and reply to candidates within 45 days.

	What happens if I don't complete the exam in 48 hours?

	When you are ready to start, you will sign up and pay to take the exam. You have 48 hours from the time you receive your exam until the time you must submit it. If you do not submit your exam within 48 hours, your attempt will count as "failed" and you will need to take another exam to proceed with the certification process.

	Can I retake the exam?

    If a candidate does not pass the Certification exam, they may retake it in the following manner:
	If a candidate does not pass their first attempt, they may immediately retake the exam.
	If a candidate does not pass their second attempt, they will be eligible for their third attempt after a two month period.
	If after three attempts, the candidate has still not passed the exam, they must wait six months. After six months, if the candidate still wishes to take the exam, they must pay for the exam to take it again.

	ID Verification Troubleshooting (for applicants who have submitted an exam)

	Make sure you have an acceptable form of ID. Acceptable forms of ID include driver's licenses, passports, or a government-issued ID. Note: student or work IDs are not accepted.
	Make sure the image and/or ID you upload is clear and not blurry. Do not obstruct your ID with your fingers if you are using a webcam.
